    - name: My name is jeramiah this is a project for the human mind.

      run: |The point to this project is a concept I call dimensional awareness.
Through the visual art which is of stone found in it natural state but cleaned I am presenting an excersise of the mind.
I just want people to know there is no definite object to be seen other then truth. This excersise is only intended to help
With the training of the mind which I call deminisional awareness. We all cannot be mathmaticians, but we all have the ability
To devlope a deminionsal understanding to the truth which surrounds us every day minute and second of this life. This is not a religious
Excersise! Nor is it intended to advocate for or anginst any human belief religion or personal truth in which one holds moral truth.
This is just an attempt to help people slow the mind and take a moment to go through a concept which is self determined. No thought is wrong in this
Process. As long as your thinking as you conceptsualize you expression if thought will change every time you use tgis excersise. This is just
A way for me to share a understanding that others might not be aware of. This is a personal journey of the mind. You can either share or not. All is welcome.
Thank you for taking the time to read this and get a chance to know of me. I hope our friendship grows through better understanding not only of our selfs but each oterh as well.
The end result for this project should be a greater understanding of how we and all things are connected through science and truth, hince
                                  TRUTH OF MANKIND
